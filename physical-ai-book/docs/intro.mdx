# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, with a focus on creating intelligent, embodied systems.

## About This Book

This book is structured into multiple modules, each building upon the previous knowledge to provide a comprehensive understanding of humanoid robotics systems:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Understanding how ROS 2 functions as the communication backbone for humanoid robots
- **Future Modules**: Advanced topics including perception, planning, control, and integration

Each module is designed to be accessible to software engineers with basic Python knowledge, AI practitioners transitioning into robotics, and students familiar with AI concepts but new to robotics.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Software engineers with basic Python knowledge
- AI practitioners transitioning into robotics
- Students familiar with AI concepts but new to ROS 2

## How to Use This Book

The content is structured with progressive complexity, starting with foundational concepts and advancing to practical implementation. Each chapter includes:
- Clear learning objectives
- Practical examples
- Real-world humanoid robot applications
- Code examples using ROS 2 and Python
